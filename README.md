# World-Happiness-Report-2024
Perform an in-depth exploratory and analytical study of global happiness to identify key social and economic factors that influence well-being worldwide. This project explores social, economic, and health factors that influence happiness across countries, revealing patterns, regional variations, and stability of well-being worldwide.

## 📌 Project Overview
The **World Happiness Report** is a powerful dataset that evaluates how people worldwide perceive their happiness and life satisfaction.  
In this project, I performed an **in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand what truly drives happiness — focusing on metrics like **GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and corruption perception**.  
The goal was to uncover actionable insights that can help explain why certain countries rank consistently higher in global well-being.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze global happiness trends and identify the major social and economic factors contributing to well-being using clear, data-driven storytelling.

## 🧩 Dataset
**Source:** [World Happiness Report – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
**Key Columns:**  
`Country`, `Year`, `Ladder Score (Happiness Score)`, `GDP per capita`, `Social Support`,  
`Healthy Life Expectancy`, `Freedom`, `Perceptions of Corruption`,  
`Upper Whisker`, `Lower Whisker`.

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Standardized column names and handled missing values.  
   - Removed redundant or non-informative columns.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Examined the overall distribution of happiness scores globally.  
   - Calculated central tendency (mean, median) and variability.  

3. **Global Happiness Distribution**  
   - Visualized global well-being patterns using histograms and density plots.  

4. **Top & Bottom 10 Countries**  
   - Compared the happiest and least happy nations, identifying socio-economic contrasts.  

5. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Evaluated relationships between happiness and core indicators:  
     GDP, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom, and Corruption.  

6. **Upper & Lower Whisker Analysis**  
   - Studied how the stability of happiness (difference between whiskers) reflects long-term well-being resilience.  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- The **average happiness score** globally falls between **5–6**, showing moderate well-being.  
- **Finland, Denmark, and Switzerland** remain the happiest countries, consistently supported by strong social systems and trust.  
- Countries with **higher social support and health metrics** show more stable happiness, even when economic conditions fluctuate.  
- The **Upper and Lower Whisker** values indicate that nations with less happiness variability tend to have **greater equality and emotional stability**.  
- Happiness depends not just on wealth, but on **social connection, trust, and security**.
